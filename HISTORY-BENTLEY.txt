SQL server plugin was unable to use SQL selects longer than 10000 characters caused by a static buffer length.
This was changed to a dynamic buffer

MapServer crashed in situations where the the bracketed select statement in the DATA statement had more than 2000 characters. The crash happened in msSplitData. The code section to dynamically extend the relevant buffer had a bug. This fixes the issue.

Bug : Mapserver (in FCGI mode) only reports valid error message for the first request, then it reports Internal error 500

Step to reproduce:
1. Introduce any error in a .map file
2. Make a request to the map file: http://<server>/<path>/mapserv.exe?MAP=<mapfileP_Path>
3. Should see a meaningfull error message.

4. Replay the same request, now you see a internal error 500.

this fix allows to have an out-of-source build on any location - previously it was assumed that the mapscript csharp sources had a fixed path relative to the build

Enable evaluation of primary key if table name is given in the format schema.tablename

SQL server plugin allows to omit "USING UNIQUE" by automatically
retrieving the name of the table's primary key. This did only work if
the table was just mentioned through it name. The fix allows you to
specify the table name as
[SERVERNAME].[DATABASENAME].[SCHEMANAME].[TABLENAME]

Included mapows.h to have correct prototype for msOWSLookupMetadata

mapserver crashed on windows with an Oracle layer (using Oracle plugin)
and "gml_types" "auto"
This was caused by using msOWSLookupMetadata without a prototype
Missing prototype gave following warning during a windows build:
Warning 13 warning C4013: 'msOWSLookupMetadata' undefined; assuming
extern returning int

Allow using double quoted aliases for Oracle column aliases

Adding double quotes to the columns of the mapserver generated outer
query safely allows using double quoted column aliases in the data
statement

Removed bug that caused MapServer only to use the Oracle TranslateFilter method at the first call e.g. in an FCGI environment

unlike all other vtable assignments the
msOracleSpatialLayerTranslateFilter was set to layer->vtable and not to
vtable
